							<h2>Things I've Done</h2>
							<p>While my research is important, I also do other things. Here are some of the recent ones.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<h3><a href="https://columbiacovid.weebly.com/team.html">Chief Organizational Officer</a>  <br /> <a href="https://cancer.columbia.edu/cracking-down-covid-19"><i>Columbia Researchers Against Coronavirus (CRAC)</i></a></h3>
									<p>With the beginning of lockdown in NYC, I was stuck at home and wanted to do anything I could to help fight the pandemic. I was lucky enough to get involved in Columbia Researchers Against Coronavirus (CRAC),
									a group of postdocs, graduate students, and researchers who were able to help fight the pandemic. As COO, I was responsible for making sure the organization was functional, especially since we grew exponentially
								  over our first month, from 1 to over 200 individuals.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Bargaining Committee Member, Organizer  <br /> <a href="https://columbiagradunion.org/bargaining/"><i>GWC-UAW Local 2110: Graduate Workers of Columbia</i> </a> </h3>
									<p>I have been at Columbia for a long time now, and over my time here it became increasingly clear that things needed to change for PhD students. Among other issues, Students have been paid late and had their insurance costs raised
									by at least 50%. Nothing ever changes if we don't get off the sidelines and fight for what we need, and I have been organizing in the union to build awareness that our issues can be addressed collectively and on our terms. I joined
									the bargaining committee to fight for those who may not be able to do so themselves, as grad school is hard enough on its own. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>President  <br /> <a href="https://www.gsas.cuimc.columbia.edu/student-life/graduate-student-organization"> <i> Columbia University Graduate Student Organization</i></a></h3>
									<p>Student government is a clearinghouse for all sorts of things at CUMC. We plan orientation and recruitment for incoming students and recruits, create and run both regular and irregular social events, and support other
										 student organizations. I started on the social committee and have occupied 3 separate positions over the years. My goal in the student government is to make it more nimble and accountable to membership. We have increased our
										 outreach and expanded our programming. One of our first initiatives was to simply document our positions, as new members would previously have to spend months just figuring out their roles before they could do anything!</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Instructor  <br /> <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/shp/"> <i>Columbia University Science Honors Program</i></a></h3>
									<p>This is personal for me, as I took part in this program when I was in High School. SHP gives highschoolers a chance do engage more directly with science, and often those that actually do it.
									I was lucky enough to be able to talk about my microbiome research, first in a standalone course, and now as part of a Bioinformatics course. Favorite lectures/discussons include the discussion of
								  the links between taxonomic thinking and modern racism, and being able to get high schoolers programming and using modern tools becasuse of open source software. </p>
